An automatic keypress simulator to keep your computer from ever entering "idle" state.

Use it in scenarious where "someone" wants to force log you out and close all your programs and windows if you are "idle" for some amount of time.

Every thirty minutes, it opens "notepad.exe", types a single character into it, then closes it.  You can of course run any other program you please.

Also, if you include (in the same folder as the .exe) a WAV file called "ping.wav", it will play that sound every thirty minutes when it does it's thing.

Included the .exe for those who can't recompile from the source.  But the source is included for those who can.
